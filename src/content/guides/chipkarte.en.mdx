## ℹ️ 1. Why extend?

With a valid chip card, you benefit from many advantages:
Cinemas, museums, and the Ulm Theater (even free with prior registration!) often offer discounts for students.

The same applies in the university cafeteria: Only with a current printout will you receive the student price – otherwise, you pay the more expensive guest rate.

## 🔐 3. How do I find my PIN?

If you have forgotten your PIN, you can retrieve it or generate a new one in the IDM portal.

1. Go to the
   👉 [IDM Portal of Ulm University](https://portal.uni-ulm.de/idmFrontend/)
2. Log in with your university account and **MFA token**.
   → [Here you can find out how to set up MFA.](https://www.ulmiversitaet.de/guides/mfa)
3. Click on **"Chip card"** in the left menu.

Now you have two options:

- **A) You have never changed your PIN:**
  Click on **"Retrieve data mirror"** – there you will find the original PIN in the PDF document.

- **B) You have already changed your PIN:**
  Click on **"Generate new PIN"**.
  A window with the new PIN will appear.
  ⚠️ **Important:** This will only be displayed once and cannot be retrieved afterwards!
