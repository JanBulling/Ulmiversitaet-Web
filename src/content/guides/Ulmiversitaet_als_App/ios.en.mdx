## ❓ What Are Web Apps?

Web apps are websites that behave like native apps on your iPhone or iPad. They are installed directly from the Safari browser and appear as standalone apps on your home screen.

**Advantages of Web Apps:**

- Quick access directly from the home screen
- No App Store installation required
- Automatic updates without manual installation

The Ulmiversity as a web app offers the same functionality as the regular website, but with the convenience of an app-like experience.

## 🛠️ Setting Up the Web App

Installing the Ulmiversity as a web app is simple and takes only a few steps. Make sure you are using Safari, as other browsers do not support this feature.

### Step 1: Open the Ulmiversity

Open Safari on your iPhone or iPad and navigate to the [Ulmiversity homepage](https://ulmiversitaet.de). You should see the main page of the website.

### Step 2: Open the Page Menu
