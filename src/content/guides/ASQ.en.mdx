## ℹ️ 1. What is ASQ?

**ASQ** stands for **Additive Key Qualifications**.
These are additional courses open to all Ulm University students. They teach cross-disciplinary skills such as **foreign languages**, **communication**, **intercultural competence**, and **academic writing**.

These courses are primarily offered by the **Department of Humanities (Philosophy, Languages, ASQ)** and may be **mandatory or elective**, depending on your degree program.

## 🧭 2. Registration via the CoronaNG Portal

ASQ registration operates on a **first-come, first-served** basis — the faster you are, the better your chances of getting a spot!
Here’s how to proceed with the registration.

First, open the Ulm University campus system (CoronaNG):

👉 [CoronaNG – ASQ Registration](https://campusonline.uni-ulm.de/CoronaNG/index.html)

- Log in with your **kiz account** – these are the same credentials you use for **Moodle**.

## 📂 3. Open the Course Overview

1. After logging in, click on **“Courses”** in the left-hand side menu.
2. You’ll see the message:
   _“The tree is being built (0%)”_
   🔁 **Refresh the page every few seconds** until the course tree has fully loaded.

---

## 📚 4. Find ASQ Courses

1. In the loaded tree, click on **“Course Catalog”**.
2. Choose **“Department of Humanities (Philosophy, Languages, ASQ)”**.
3. Then click on **“Additive Key Qualifications (ASQ)”**.
4. Next, open **“Foreign Languages and Intercultural Competence”** to view all available ASQ courses.

📖 **Tip:** Expand the entire tree to see the full list of available courses.

## 👀 5. Watch ASQs

If you find a course you like:

1. Click on the **name of the ASQ** to open its detail page.

2. There you’ll find information such as:
   - Number of participants
   - Dates and time period
   - Instructor
   - Room or online link

3. Scroll down to the **“Action”** section and click
   **“Watch this course”**.

You can watch as many courses as you like at the same time.

## 📝 6. Apply for Participation

1. In the left menu, open **“My CoronaNG → Watched Courses & Participation”**.
2. At the top, you’ll see all the courses you’re watching.
3. Select the desired courses using the **checkboxes** on the left.
4. Click **“Participate in selected”** at the top.
5. Then press the **“Execute”** button.

🕓 The button is **only activated on the registration day** (usually the **first day of the semester at 4:00 PM**).

💡 **Note:** You can **apply for multiple ASQs simultaneously** this way.
Please **withdraw from any courses you don’t intend to attend** after the allocation phase.

## ⚡ 7. Technical Notes

- Access works most reliably **within the university network** (eduroam® or VPN).
- If your connection is slow, loading the course tree may take longer.
- If you need help or encounter errors, you can find manuals and support pages on Ulm University’s website.

## 👩‍💻 8. Automated Registration

For the computer nerds — there’s a script on [Valentin Kolb’s blog](https://valentin-kolb.blog/blog/2024-11-20) that automates registration:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
watch -n 1 curl 'https://campusonline.uni-ulm.de/CoronaNG/user/mycorona.html' \
--compressed \
-X POST \
-H 'Cookie: JSESSIONID={SESSION_ID}; {...}' \
--data-raw 'check_{ASQ_1_ID}=on&action=5' > out.html
```
