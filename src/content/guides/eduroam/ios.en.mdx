## 📲 1. Download the App

Download the official “geteduroam” app from the App Store:

👉 [geteduroam on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/geteduroam/id1504076137?l=en-GB)

---

## 🔎 2. Select Your University

- Open the app after installation
- Enter **“Ulm University”** in the search field and select the correct entry

---

## 🔐 3. Log In with Your kiz Account

- **Username:**
  `firstname.lastname@uni-ulm.de`
- **Password:**
  Your **kiz password** (the same one you use, for example, for Moodle)

---

## ✅ 4. Confirm the Connection

- Tap **“Allow”** when prompted to install the configuration profile
- Then tap **“Connect”**

Your device will now automatically connect to eduroam®.

---

## 👁️ 5. Verify the Connection

Once you are within the university’s Wi-Fi range, you can check whether your device is successfully connected to eduroam®:

- At the bottom of the Ulmiversity site, a message will automatically appear saying "_Connected to eduroam®_."

🛑 **Important:** This indicator **does not work** if **iCloud Private Relay** is enabled on your device — in that case, your connection is anonymized and the detection is blocked.

## 📎 Notes

- If you change your password, you must repeat the setup process
