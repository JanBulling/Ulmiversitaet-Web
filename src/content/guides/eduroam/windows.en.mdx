## 🌐 1. Download the Configuration Profile

Open the official configuration page:

👉 [eduroam® Configuration Assistant](https://cat.eduroam.org/?idp=5074&profile=13597)

- The correct **profile for Windows** will be detected automatically and should now download.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Install the Profile

1. **Double-click** the downloaded `.exe` file.
2. Follow the instructions of the installation wizard.

---

## 🔐 3. Enter Your Login Credentials

In the next dialog, enter your login information:

- **Username:**
  `firstname.lastname@uni-ulm.de`
- **Password:**
  Your **kiz password** (the same one you use, for example, for Moodle)

You may also be prompted to enter your **Windows system password** to complete the setup.

---

## ✅ 4. Confirm the Connection

- After successful installation, your PC should automatically connect to **eduroam®**.
- In the Wi-Fi list (bottom right in the taskbar), **eduroam** should now appear as connected.

---

## 👁️ 5. Verify the Connection

When you are within the university’s Wi-Fi range, you can check if your device is successfully connected to eduroam®:

- At the top of the Ulmiversity site, a message will automatically appear saying "_Connected to eduroam®_."

## 📎 Notes

- If you change your password, the profile must be **reinstalled**.
