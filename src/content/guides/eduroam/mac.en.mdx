## 🌐 1. Download the Configuration Profile

Open the official configuration page:

👉 [eduroam® Configuration Assistant](https://cat.eduroam.org/?idp=5074&profile=13597)

- The correct **profile for macOS** will be detected automatically and should now download.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Install the Profile

1. **Double-click** the downloaded `.mobileconfig` file.
2. Open **System Settings** and select the notification about the new profile (usually shown at the top).
3. Double-click **“eduroam®”** and then click **Install**. Confirm all dialogs by selecting **“Continue”** or **“Allow”**.

---

## 🔐 3. Enter Your Login Credentials

In the next dialog, enter your login information:

- **Username:**
  `firstname.lastname@uni-ulm.de`
- **Password:**
  Your **kiz password** (the same one you use, for example, for Moodle)

You may also be prompted to enter your **macOS system password** to complete the installation.

---

## ✅ 4. Confirm the Connection

- After successful installation, your Mac should automatically connect to **eduroam®**.
- In the Wi-Fi menu (top right in the menu bar), **eduroam** should now appear as connected.

---

## 👁️ 5. Verify the Connection

When you are within the university’s Wi-Fi range, you can check if your device is successfully connected to eduroam®:

- At the top of the Ulmiversity site, a message will automatically appear saying "_Connected to eduroam®_."

🛑 **Important:** This indicator **does not work** if **iCloud Private Relay** is enabled on your device — the connection will be anonymized and detection will be blocked.

---

## 📎 Notes

- If you change your password, the profile must be **reinstalled**.
