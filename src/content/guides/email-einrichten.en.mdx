description: Whether Apple Mail, Gmail, Thunderbird, or any other client — the setup process is always very similar. This guide explains how to access your university emails directly from your favorite mail app, anywhere.

This guide is based on an older KIZ manual (see [here](https://www.uni-ulm.de/einrichtungen/kiz/service-katalog/e-mail-kalender-zusammenarbeit/e-mail/e-mail-programme-konfigurieren/)).

## 1. Add a New Email Account

Usually found under `Settings > Add Account`, you can add a new email account there.
Log in using your university email address (`firstname.lastname@uni-ulm.de`, sometimes with `-1`, `-2`, … if your name is already taken) and your university password.
The password is the same one you use for all other university services (e.g., Sogo).

## 2. IMAP Settings

For manual setup, select `IMAP` as the protocol or account type.
Many mail apps automatically detect the correct settings, but some may require manual configuration.

The manual settings for <u>**incoming mail**</u> are:

**(IMAP) Server:**

```
imap.uni-ulm.de
```

**Port:**

```
993
```

**Security Type:**

```
SSL/TLS
```

---

For <u>**outgoing mail**</u>, use the following configuration:

**(SMTP) Server:**

```
mail.uni-ulm.de
```

**Port:**

```
587
```

**Security Type:**

```
STARTTLS
```

## 3. Done!

That’s it — simple as that!
And the best part: it works the same way in every email app!
