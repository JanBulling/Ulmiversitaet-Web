description: Whether Apple Mail, Gmail, Thunderbird, or any other client — the setup process is always very similar. This guide explains how to access your university E-Mails directly from your favorite mail app, anywhere.

This guide is based on an older KIZ manual (see [here](https://www.uni-ulm.de/einrichtungen/kiz/service-katalog/e-mail-kalender-zusammenarbeit/e-mail/e-mail-programme-konfigurieren/)).

## 1. Add a New E-Mail Account

Usually found under `Settings > Add Account`, you can add a new E-Mail account there.
Log in using your university E-Mail address (`firstname.lastname@uni-ulm.de`, sometimes with `-1`, `-2`, … if your name is already taken) and your university password.
The password is the same one you use for all other university services (e.g., Sogo).

## 2. IMAP Settings

For manual setup, select `IMAP` as the protocol or account type.
Many mail apps automatically detect the correct settings, but some may require manual configuration.

The manual settings for <u>**incoming mail**</u> are:

**(IMAP) Server:**

```
imap.uni-ulm.de
```

**Port:**

```
993
```

**Security Type:**

```
SSL/TLS
```

---

For <u>**outgoing mail**</u>, use the following configuration:

**(SMTP) Server:**

```
mail.uni-ulm.de
```

**Port:**

```
587
```

**Security Type:**

```
STARTTLS
```

## 3. Done!

That’s it — simple as that!
And the best part: it works the same way in every E-Mail app!
